        <h5 class="card-title">Overview</h5>
        <p>Solo Project. A 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF) exploration-adventure game being created for the final year
          project. I was inspired by games such as Descent (1995), Metroid Prime (2002) and System Shock (1994) in
          creating this project.
        <p>Proximity Threat is a prototype of a 6DOF first person adventure game. 6 degrees of
          freedom means that the player can rotate, pitch, yaw and move horizontally and vertically.
          Examples of games that use the 6DOF movement system include Descent (1995), Overload (2018) and Forsaken
          (1998).
        </p>
        <p>Proximity Threat intends to standout from other entries in the 6DOF genre by having an exploration focus and
          a world progression system based off 3D metroidvania games, while also having a large persistent to
          explore and progress in.</p>
        <p>Proximity Threat is still in development and may possibly become a full sized project depending on feedback
          and time after completion of the third year project. It is currently password restricted on the Itch.io
          website as it is not ready to publically show off.</p>

          <p>The only art created and shown in the screenshots is the player's 3D drone, other than that the project has exclusively been a programming focused one at this point.
            Art assets have been obtained from asset stores and public domain sources so far.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="card-title">Tools used</h5>
        <p>- Hack n Plan for sprint cycle planning. </p>
        <p>- Unity HDRP for creating the game. </p>
        <p>- Photoshop for some UI elements, thumbnails and prototyping.</p>
        <p>- Blender for 3D modelling and some texturing and texture painting. As of the current version only the player
          drone has been 3D modelled so far.</p>
        <p>- GitHub for version control.</p>
        <p>- Draw.Io for creating initial map designs and UML diagrams.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Proximity Threat currently features</h5>
        <p>- A full six-degrees of freedom movement system including autoleveling using the player's rigidbody.</p>
        <p>- A full 3D map system, the game is broken down into multiple rooms. Each room can be selected and the player
          can see their location in the in game map or in the minimap. When a player enters a new room the game will
          recognise the player is in a new room through room triggers then update the map and player's location.</p>
        <p>- A mini radar (top right of screenshots) which indicates the position of enemies around the player</p>
        <p>- A look lock mechanic, pressing a button will make the player lock onto and look at a target either to shoot
          at or to scan.</p>
        <p>- Scanning and log entry system for the player to explore the environment around them in more detail. Some
          objects are loggable and therefore are stored in the player's logbook which is accessed through the menu.</p>
        <p>- A full working settings menu where the player can rebind their control scheme, other control options,
          graphics settings and audio settings.</p>
        <p>- Respawning system upon drone destruction, the player restarts from 'drone printers' throughout the map,
          progress is not lost (unless drone printers are nonfunctional).</p>
        <p>- Full Xbox Controller Support, and Mouse and Keyboard Support.</p>
        <br>
        <h5 class="card-title">What I learnt</h5>
        <p>- Unity provides a good template for key rebindings, it can easily be customised to meet a project's needs. I
          however did not start this until later in the project which meant needing to redo the input controls. This is
          also my first time using Unity's new input system.</p>
        <p>- Learnt a lot in depth about the 6DOF genre and market research for the genre. This has exposed me to a lot
          of games I never played before and a genre I now really enjoy.</p>
        <p>- Learnt about Unity HDRP, this is the first project I have used Unity HDRP for as I wanted to explore the
          full use of options for high-end games.</p>
        <p>- Learnt in depth about user testing and question templates such as the player experience inventory (PXI).
        </p>
        <p>- Learnt a bit about writing shaders and how shaders work, for example using the ShaderLab command ZTest Always to always draw the scan icons even if inside game objects.
        </p>
        <p>- I initially wanted to use Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) for Proximity Threat, I managed to get some experience with
          UE5 in September 2023 but decided to switch in favour Unity HDRP. Unity HDRP fitted the functional, domain and
          non-functional requirements of the project I wanted to create as well as meeting those requirements in a
          relatively short time frame (6 months alongside all other commitments). I plan to use UE5 again in the future
          for a different project.</p>
